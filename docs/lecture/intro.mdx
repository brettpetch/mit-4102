# Intro

Arts based enteurpernurship. Lets start with a syllabus:

This is a class on how to start and run your own small creative business. It will be unlike another FIMS class. Works here 1/2 time, rest of the time is running her own business.

## Syllabus (see attached)

## What it's about

How small businesses work, what they do and to some extent how they do it. It will be useful if you want to run your own business, work for someone else's business or if you wanted to consume something from a business.

We'll talk about marketing tactics, and you'll find that you could change your consumption habits.

> Even if you're thinking the thought that starting a business is something I wouldn't want to do because I'm risk adverse. In making the company SheepSpot has been the most satisfying, fulfilling, fun thing I've done.

Along the way you're going to make up a business idea, then apply it to the questions that will be asked. Doesn't need to be something you could do then or even 5 yrs from now. It'll just help around the question. There are no right answers, but some are better than others. In my own business, we found that what works for you is what's best for the business and its employees.

Small business, really about knowing yourself, what you enjoy doing, knowing what you're terrible at, and what really makes you feel great about getting up and going to work in the morning.

There will be alot of writing, exporation of your own tendancies, and refining your business idea. That is the central text of the class.

## Background

Wanted to do as little harm as possible. It's really about [right livelyhood](https://www.learnreligions.com/right-livelihood-the-ethics-of-earning-a-living-450071). It's really about doing the right thing. Finding a way to making your way into the world.

See podcast \[Unemployable\]

It's not about looking outward.

### Story about work

The broader historical context of the moment atm. Everyone is worried about getting a job, what are you worried about?

> competition, covid lack of hiring, underqualified.

You just don't know what your qualifications are. In the 1970's there has been a steady shift in how we have undone work. We've undone most of the social contract that used to exist around work. Capitalism isn't the best for people doing work. So, lets take a look at two people in her family. Allan Greenspan, chair of federal reserve during bush and obama years. It was taken in Detroit, they met in the Federal Reserve. Greenspan is looking like a young terp. In 1908, the fist job out of law school was for the federal reserve as a lawyer for the bank. Any kind of negotiation was what he specialized in (in a legal sense). He worked there until the mid 70's when he retired.

#### The stable employer

His relationship to his employer was the central relationships of his life. It was a reciprocal relationship from which they both benefit. During that period in the states, the labour movement was expanding, huge gains around labor around collective bargining, etc. You also had the expectation that you'd work at 2-3 places for the duration of your life. He was in a deeply reciprocal relationship with them. Around the 1970's things started to change. Partially in capitalism, collective labour, redefining various terms of the social contract under Raeganism. That reciprocal bond got broken. Employers no longer had to have that relationship with their employees. Now it's mutually exploitative. You go to your job, do as little work as possible, go to your home; not feeling like it owed you more than a paycheck.

#### The breaking of work

The motion out of retroprocity shifts again and capital decides that it doesn't need to give its employees anything. (gig economy job). No one is in a relationship with Uber. That contract has really been broken. The contract for a long time in the 20th century was that you go to work and come home. In this context, there are more opportunities to figure out a "right livelihood way" of earning your living. There are more now than there were in the last 500 years. That's what makes this such an interesting moment to look at. Ways of talking to your audience that were previously unavailable, ways of moving product, targeting a small group of people and building a relationship with that group of people.

#### The story about work

Hand woven wool, spinning. We're going step-by-step through the business model next week. There was a blog post written, [**1000 true fans**](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/). If you have 1000 poeple who love you and your stuff that you've fostered a connection with over time. Poeple will buy whatever you do. If you have 1000 true fans, you can make a living. This is at the micro-level. This is why you'd never learn this at Ivey. It's being pitched for creatives because that's what is understood.

### Story about Dad

Dad and 1/2 sister. He was a professional artist / art teacher for his whole career. John Torrez. He died in 2001 in massive amounts of debt. He died in a hospital (with no health insurance), etc. at 63. He was an amazingly hard worker. He wasn't ever able to figure it out. One of the missions of sheepspot was that I wanted to prove that. He barely had e-bay. There was no way for him to forge a connection with the people who loved his work other than in 1-1 sessions in Richmond, VA. We think alot about the starving artist paradigm. There's no way to make it in this world against an entitiy with more capital than you'd ever have. You can hitch your start to them, they're not hitching the star to you. You can hitch your star to someone and they're likely not in your corner the way you would hope.

As a university teacher, they didn't have the same relationship to me that I have to them. If you wanted to have more agency in your own life, this is something to think about. I see _my_ role here as a mentor for you as you think about these questions. I'm going to tell you about the bad things I've had happen, huge launches that have flopped, pivots, how I found my people, and how they were different from who I thought my people were, and that's how I see _my_ role among you guys.

### Schedule

We're going to start the course by looking at 2 case studies. The first week Sheepspot, then a non-profit (that I think) is killing it. The Ocean Cleanup. We're going to talk about the ways that they're killing it. Ocean Cleanup is working towards clearing the ocean of plastic by 2035. They've deployed the newest tech to the garbage patch and it's working. We're going to look at their branding and comms strategies. It's also a good time to look at mission and values. Those are things we center when we're setting up a businesss. That's the key to your [Thousand True Fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/). They'll pick you because you're the one that will have a clear way of why those questions are important. It's also a good example of right livelihood not-through-profit.

One the 29th, we're going to start working through these questions

#### What Am I Good at / What do I Love to Do?

This is the starting point. Light yourself up. Something you've done when you've done a full launch for something no-one bought. It's nice to not feel like doing a job. It's an amazing gift.

#### What do I Value, What do I want to see more of in the world? How do I want to make my intervention

#### Who are my people? (My 1000 true people)

Your ICA is your ideal customer. We'll be doing some exercises to find who exactly that person is. Your thing is for everybody, your thing is for nobody. Unless you can explain why your thing is different, not even better. DIFFERENT... You're not going to get very far. Forging that very specific thing and knowing your audience. We'll talk about market research. We'll talk about _my_ ideal customer. You'll find your ICA and talk to them. You'll talk about comms, listening, and social media (how it's the be-all and end-all). Collect email addresses, it still works.

Product development, what works, what lights you and your customers up, putting yourself together into a values proposition. Test that your idea would work

Week off, different business models, lots of possiblities. Then we'll think about branding (as a kind of visual or graphical expression) of values / expression of the business. It's not even the most important thing. It's a very important piece, but not as important as you think it is.

#### How to make a plan

If you're a spreadsheet person, that's OK, but some of you aren't so we'll talk about other ways to plan / strategize. You will then work on a business plan that will be your final assignment, then you'll spend a few weeks working on that in class.

#### Expectations

We'll (godwilling) be meeting in this room. This class happens in real-time. If we need to go virtual, we'll still remain syncronous. Hence that attendance / participation grades, there's an appendix, but it's missing. TL;DR you need to be here and interacting. Don't freak out.

Reading. Business books suck. Most of them are really slight without alot of heft, with not good writing. There is **The Right Brain Business Plan** by **Jennifer Lee**. I'm going to ask you to get yourself a copy of a book, figure out what's useful, then create a short reading for your classmates.

##### Assignments

5/7 done. must me 2 pages 2 spaced. You might only need to give me a single piece of paper. Will be counting words.

Take home final, waiting on how they're handling take-home exams right now. No due date yet.

## For Next Week

Find a business that you appreciate, do they communicate to you about our first three questions?

What are you good at?

Mission/values
Ideal Customer
Pick a business, talk to people about them, descern those 3 things.
What lights them up, how do they communicate it, how do you know that's what's happening?

Come to class ready to talk about that.

Break.

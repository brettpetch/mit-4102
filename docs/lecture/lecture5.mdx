Names are not that important for a business. Don't get hung up on them. One thing to think about them when trying out potential names is to go to hover.com. If you haven't ever built a site, you can use something like Squarespace. They are generally looking good, easy to put together. You can do a full site in a day. Wix is another one, sami says wix is bad because unless you pay you have WIX. 

You'll want a home page with a pop-up to gather emails, and a lead magnet. The kind of functionality you need is relative to your lead magent. You'll need an about page, which is generally written lively. 

You'll also want an about page, a shop page, , Privacy Policy. Instead of using your name, you could seperate it. 

Where does your ICA hang out on the internet? What social media does your ICA use, why? Zone them in on the right place. You may want to point out where they might play out.

As part of your lead magnet, you could use something like an email provider like Drip or Mailchimp. Most of the time it's a freemium model. What they're doing is sending emails out to your list and enforcing the rule of email. You have to have an unsubscribe button, legally obligated to do. They'll also ensure that your emails are less likely to be caught by mail filters.

Don't focus on growing numbers, instead focus on **being worth following**. Start from the premise of not wasting peoples time. it'll take you far in life. Because you're doing something outside of social media, your growth is actually happening by putting effor into posts rather than growing a particular following.

The bones-no-bones following. People who do very frequent posts that are very similar to eachother. The secret to bones/no bones is the simplicity. When you see it, you know exactly what you're going to watch. 

3 gives one ask. The whole point is to be worth following. 

So we don't know what a triangle is... we don't know how to interperate it without an accompanying story, you become a student of story structures.

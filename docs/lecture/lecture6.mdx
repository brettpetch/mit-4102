## My Biggest Business Goof
So we're going to talk about this today because it was a product development problem. In March 2018, I was worried about money when I was cooking this idea up. It's not a good mindset to have when you're coming up with a product. You get very attached to the idea when you have 0 evidence that it's going to work. I decided that I was going to offer a course, the course was called "Bust your Spinning Ruts". And that was my first mistake. The name was bad. If I called it "spin any yarn you like", maybe. I have people in my face-to-face yarns. Very uncomfortable moving beyond their "comfort/default" yarns.

Being more versatile in spinning is a thing for me but not for everyone. I went all-in. Product launching is its whole thing. This class was talked about as a whole podcast, etc. All newsletters were devoted to this course. Tonnes of traffic but there was an issue. There was a price that was too high. My audience was not good with being changed like that. It was more expensive. Wrong thing, wrong audience, too expensive. I open the cart (thing is for sale on site). Half a day passes, there's a whole email drip for this, and no one had bought it after a day. Huge spike in traffic. No dice.

It was horrible. I went to my husband and said I'm going to pull the plug on this. Obviously I was broken but also it was clear that I needed to do a massive re-think. The failure here was that it was named/priced/validated. I failed to validate the idea. 

You need to have market research. Talk to the customer. Validating is what you do in order to reduce risk before offering the thing.

So what I want to do is introduce the ideas of pain points. Today we're talking about **jobs, pains, gains** in order to get to know your ICA, the context in which they make decisions and what they hope to gain. 

Get out a piece of paper.

jobs
Jobs are something that your customer is trying to get done. Either in their personal life, their professional life. Make a list of what your ICA is trying to accomplish.]

Prompts: What are the different contexts your cutomers might be in? 

IS your ICA a parent, and do they have a job? do they volunteer? also have friends? ICAs care for children/parents.

What do they need to get done that need interaction with other people?

How might your product be a pain-killer or accomplish jobs that are important to them. Then you test against fit. 

## Presentation on ""
The business canvas
- Value should be higher than cost.

Cheap hypothesis. 

do CTRs for different thing.said

So we're going to take a little bit of time to walk you through the value mapping process in the book. The book gives you prompts. If you've never thought of these questions before, you'd 

Value Proposition
- COGS
    - Raw materials
    - Labour
    - Packaging
    - E-commerce fees
    - % overhead
- Talking about the product in a way that makes clear how a product addresses these things. -> in order to think thorugh a value proposition, you need to ask yourself questions about
    - Pains relieved
    - Gains Enabled
- Next
    - co-creation
    - Validating
    - Interview
    - observe
    - Impersonating

We're looking for fit. What isn't your product addressing? what doesn't it do?

### Validate
Once you've realized this, what are you validating? Interview, observe, you're going to pretend you are them.

Co-create. Get customer involved in the actual process by which you develop and fine-tune the product. You'll be miles ahead if you do this work. Get customer feedback before you offer thing.

Using social media, how might you do that?

Ask them what they'd like to see? Show two different colours, etc. what do they want to see?

Give some people small things, offer some hypothetical. 

Validation with respect to 

Limited designs, sell them before anything else for info.

### Writing for Copy
The #1 mistake people make in communication is that they focus on the features of the offer. So, it's 8x11.5, purple, in a white frame, etc. Instead, lets focus on benefits. Benefits have to do with Jobs, pains, gains. So you absolutely want to describe features. But, you need to write copy that always links features to benefits. 

Presence @ event as part of features. How structured shots, dealing with models, physical presence in the space. Coordination.

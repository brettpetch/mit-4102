## My Biggest Business Goof
So we're going to talk about this today because it was a product development problem. In March 2018, I was worried about money when I was cooking this idea up. It's not a good mindset to have when you're coming up with a product. You get very attached to the idea when you have 0 evidence that it's going to work. I decided that I was going to offer a course, the course was called "Bust your Spinning Ruts". And that was my first mistake. The name was bad. If I called it "spin any yarn you like", maybe. I have people in my face-to-face yarns. Very uncomfortable moving beyond their "comfort/default" yarns.

Being more versatile in spinning is a thing for me but not for everyone. I went all-in. Product launching is its whole thing. This class was talked about as a whole podcast, etc. All newsletters were devoted to this course. Tonnes of traffic but there was an issue. There was a price that was too high. My audience was not good with being changed like that. It was more expensive. Wrong thing, wrong audience, too expensive. I open the cart (thing is for sale on site). Half a day passes, there's a whole email drip for this, and no one had bought it after a day. Huge spike in traffic. No dice.

It was horrible. I went to my husband and said I'm going to pull the plug on this. Obviously I was broken but also it was clear that I needed to do a massive re-think. The failure here was that it was named/priced/validated. I failed to validate the idea. 

You need to have market research. Talk to the customer. Validating is what you do in order to reduce risk before offering the thing.

So what I want to do is introduce the ideas of pain points. Today we're talking about **jobs, pains, gains** in order to get to know your ICA, the context in which they make decisions and what they hope to gain. 

Get out a piece of paper.

jobs
Jobs are something that your customer is trying to get done. Either in their personal life, their professional life. Make a list of what your ICA is trying to accomplish.]

Prompts: What are the different contexts your cutomers might be in? 

IS your ICA a parent, and do they have a job? do they volunteer? also have friends? ICAs care for children/parents.

What do they need to get done that need interaction with other people?

## Housekeeping

First we're going to talk about our small-business ideas, then I'm going to collect some prompts, talk about the first assignment and have our first presentation.

I just want to spend some time to talk about my launch which is happening now. There've been some moments where I felt like it was going to kill me. We're at 50 new members, which is quite good. We'll likely see an uptick on Thursday, because people leave things until last minute. I'd likely have been there if I hadn't screwed up the live for my members; after a fight with my [husband] (significant other). I'd be happy to see 60 new members.

Now I'd like to put you into your presentation groups. This requires you to move around a bit.

:::tip PSA
If you weren't here this week, be sure to reach out with your group and share your top 3 business ideas.
:::

### Business Ideas

So, we have had around 10-15 mins to talk, some groups had some good conversations. Lets hear some of what you guys talked about.

:::info Some ideas from the class

- Nieche podcasts,
- Small jewlery.
- Rental company, renting out furnature to uni students.
- Stooping, when people leave stuff "free to take", then making it better, reselling.
- Costume Design for Irish Dance
- D&D hold sessions for new players to teach/run game.

:::

### Brainstorming - Skills & Talents

So, why is it that you are dreading thinking about your skills and talents? Why does it feel like something hard to do? "Self reflecting. I don't like that". "Whenever you're good at something you'll find out that someone else is better and/or opening up to critisisms". So, take around 15 index cards and pass the stack along. So, everyone's got a pen with index cards.

We're doing this exercise because we are all more or less socialized to be a bit out of touch with what we're good at. It's because it's not modest to know what you're good at. "I" think it's dangerous to go through life without knowing what you're good at and it makes people unhappy. "I" also think that starting a business without understanding what you bring to it is courting disaster. We're fine with failure. BUT: I think you can get into trouble if you're good at something and you don't know it, or vise-versa. Self-reflective moments now and then. At your age it'll be changing all the time. Do it once a year or so just to check in.

The downside of not knowing what you're good at:

Previous to Western, tought at university in Baltimore. It was a snake pit, lots of competitiveness in meetings. People were assholes, others were powerhouses. From that experience I took on sounding authoritative. After I left that job, in small group situations people would think that I as in / on board / it was the best idea. It took a series of non-work situations to realize that sounding authoritative was good, especially in teaching although I needed to learn how to dial it back.

Series of prompts: Write one skill on each index card. Quantity over quality.

### Ask Yourself --

:::note
Take around a minute to ask yourself each question
:::

#### Think about your life, not just your Western Life. Are there things you don't really do much anymore.

:::note

#### Are there things you can't just stop talking about

:::note

Now go categorize them. After this, exchange cards with the person sitting next to you and see how they categorize them.

#### So, what was that like? how did it feel?

## The First assignment

### What we talked about in class

Ok. So the first assignment is on OWL and will become available to you right at the end of class. Before I tell you what's in it, I'd like to make some things clear. Some of you had no idea what you signed up for when you joined. I'm asking you to do non-standard FIMS things. If I asked you to do experiments then gave you bad grades for it.

Grades are terrible. They make people super-risk-adverse. Risk-aversion and entropreneurship do not go well together. When I read the first part, is this person taking a risk? If so, encourage rather than punish.

I don't want these to be scary, adversive, or even very difficult.

The first assignment is a list of prompts that we used in class today, then the assignment asks you to re-visit your cards. Now that it's feeding you this question, continue writing these down for the next 24 hrs, then revisit the categorization question. In the next couple days, ask people you trust / know you well if they have anything to add. Then, there will be 3 options on how to write about what you've learned.

1. Did you learn something about yourself you weren't fully aware of
2. Patterns
3. If you find this adversive, think about why.

400-500 words **HARD LIMIT** about one of those questions.

You're going to turn-it-in via OWL. **\*\*It is due the day of class at 3pm.\*\***

You can write in the first person **please do**. There is not a particular format. Informal essay. Is it OK to use contractions? Yes. **No citations**.

### Assignment Instructions

1. Continue exploring and listing your skills and talents using the questions we discussed in class. And ask friends, family, and mentors what they think you're good at:

   - think about your whole life, not just your Western life (i.e. think about your pastâ€”skills you haven't used in a long time)

   - think about all areas of your life, not just "professional" skills

   - ask yourself: what's easy for me, even effortless? (We often don't consider things that are easy for us skills. They are.)

   - another version: what do you do when you feel stressed?

   - ask yourself: when do I feel most alive/happiest/strongest etc?

   - another version: what do you do when you feel stressed?

   - what compliments do you often brush off?

   - are there areas in which you have some skills and want to get better?

   - what skills have you been forced to develop?

   - what makes you a little odd?

   - are there skills that you have but wish you didn't have?

   - what topics can't you stop talking about?

   - what do you know a lot about just because you're intrinsically motivated to learn more?

When you're satisfied with your list, go on to step 2.

2. Now you'll experiment with identifying patterns and relating your skills to each other. You can use whatever categories make sense to you. You might consider categories like:

   - things I'm good at that I haven't done in a long time
   - things I'm good at that I love doing
   - things I'm good at that I don't love doing
   - skills I could get paid for
   - skills I want to get better at

3. Choose one of the following prompts and write a short, informal (but well-organized, well-edited, and well-proofread) essay.

   - Write a short, informal essay about what you've discovered about yourself by doing these exercises.
   - Write about the patterns you discovered after making your list.
   - If you found listing your skills difficult or unpleasant, write about why.

## Presentation

> Having developed an understanding of chapter 2's "Dream business fundamentals," do you think that a hobby can be turned into

### Summary

Grow your handmade business, Chapman.

- 2-3. The author begins by sharing her first experience of opening a business, a cupcake shop. Made a business plan to open a bakery. She realized this wasn't for her.

- Teaching (people) how to create a business plan based on their values.

- Hobby, something you do for fun and make no money.

- Seperate from work. A business is to support oneself.

- Chapman's Questions
  - How many hours do you want to work?
  - How many hours
  - How much money
  - Tools?
  - Working Style
  - Personal/pro support

How are you different? Be different, be brave.

### Fundamentals

Where you are, where you want to go. Create a mission statement. Summarize why you're in business and what is it?

Mission statement is good to find yourself again.

"cutting edge online learning experiences..." Chapman, relecting on feelings. Be in touch with your feelings in how much energy, time, and how decisions are made. Your feelings will be reflected on the business and customers.

Keep it simple and decline gracefully. Stay true to yourself. Don't say yes to everything. Say yes only to opportunities that don't ... your morals.

Only offer something you're 110% proud of. Setting goals is a perfect time to dream.

Dreaming will help set goals.

- Without goals, you don't have anything to work towards.

The intention is your overall goal, goals are stepping stones. Begin where you want to end, then work backwards. Avoid projects you don't want to work on.

Hire externally for things you don't want to work on yourself.

If goals feel like chores, they need to change. They can help you stay organized, etc. and feel accomplished. It's important to recharge body/mind.

Businesses require you to be all-in every day. You need to treat yourslf as if you're an employee of your own business. Chapman's business plan: know industry, finances, how to profit, budget, and how to make it work.

Business plans

- Who what where why and how of business. You can choose to focus on one section that you feel is best. Nothing is final in writing a business plan.

A business plan, cover page, mission statement, staff positions, product photos, description of services, marketing plans, target market.

Knowing your market: know your competition, your target market, etc. how is your business unique to the target market?

Money is the name of the game, know your profit/loss, expenses, and amount of money being brought into the business.

How to make your business legit: do it correctly. 3 types of small businesses, insurances/liability.

Readers asking for prof/personal support is ok and informs how to get it.

### Critique

2-3 of Chapman's Grow your Handmade Business. She notes that the text is limited to the creative entropreneur. Gives mindset, resources, etc. for building a creative business. Different value, outcome of business for creatives.

#### Pros

- Written in 1st person, intimate ins/outs of starting an arts-based business. Encoruages imaginative thinking, dream, emphasise dreaming. Reinforce reality when choosing to start a business. We're not getting an unrealistic account, we're also getting reminders of keeping it real.
- Thought provoking exercises. Encourages reader to contemplate themselves in relationship to their business they're imagining.
- Questions
  - How much money?
  - How to get off ground
  - What if you didn't try?
  - Visualize your dream life. (46)
- You must be willing to do the work
- Mission statement, alot of people she pulls in have a tactic of writing thoughts down. Flowchart, what do your income streams have in common?
  - Look at what you're dealing with as a business, then find common ground.
- Autenticity in a business is key. The person that starts it is the backbone.
- Connections with the self, family, friends, keeping them healthy.
- Business is following a path that is healthy, "is your ... in line with where you want to go, who you want to become?"
- Didn't expect author to say you can stop and start over.
- Excersise, write your ideal job description
- Track projects time-wise
- Guess how long a task will take you, then make adjustments.
- 205, "message i'm putting out there"
- 10 websites target consumer would visit
- 231, financial paperwork
- 287, how to go into business with family/friend.

- Chaplain pulls on entropreneurs from different creative industries as social proof. Their experiences/opinions are used to formulate plan.
  - Obstacles, stories, etc.

### Discussion

> "Having a developed understanding of chapter 2's 'dream business fundamentals', do you think that a hobby can be turned into a profitable business that remains enjoyable? Or do you think that turning a hobby into a business will strip the enjoyment of it? Overall, should business and pleasure remain seperate?"

- Authenticity, your morals transparency, etc. is all in tact. Will filter down to everyone.
- Maybe not seperate, it doesn't need to be perfect, wheras business does need to be. Kills creativity, etc. Making opportunities to be creative without trying to be perfect.
- Hobby to business, address your desires into something your customer would like to make.

> "After gaining insight on the struggles of balancing "running acompany while running your life" as discussed in chapter 3 "working for your vision", what are a few ways that you could help speerate your work life from personal life?

- Keeping work seperate from home, living space. Define where worklife starts and business ends.
- Flexible doesn't work for all businesses. It's really about being active during the most productive days
- saying no is ok.

Close your eyes,

> "You're waking up in your home on a typical workday. nothing special about this. Your business is successful. You don't have any business worries. Perfect business, perfect bed, etc. no worries. You do what you do normally, coffee or tea, notice the details, what the house looks like and what you look like. By now you've had breakfast, walked your dog, gone to the gym, etc."

> where do you go to do your work? do you go to your office in a mansion, a shop in your favourite neighbourhood? Once in your space, what does it look like? Do you work at a desk with state of the art computer system, a table with scraps, what do you see in your space? do clients come in and out? do you see a packing/shipping area? is it full of ...

> Did you gain any clarity about your business, yourself?

> What really matters to you? What did you wear to your job? This was one of the exercises from the book?

## Back to Prof

I've previously talked about how we're bad at teaching you things in FIMS.

In that presentation, you're all pretty killer at presentations. Very rarely, I encounter someone that's not good at a presentation.

One of them was synthesizing information. Relatability, engaging audience, projection, public speaking, being respectful of contributors, writing, thinking/reading.

Making this point was just to underscore, just to keep thinking about this and be a bit more modest while thinking of these things in preparation for the assignment. All of these things are something that all of you could manage. Now, we have 15 mins. One thing to highlight is that chafin has a full chapter on mentorship. Finding mentors, how to establish a good relationship, etc.

For those without mentors, would you like one?

- You could try joining a club, group, etc. with similar interests.

Business people will setup opportunties, etc.

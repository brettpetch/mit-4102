## Housekeeping

First we're going to talk about our small-business ideas, then I'm going to collect some prompts, talk about the first assignment and have our first presentation.

I just want to spend some time to talk about my launch which is happening now. There've been some moments where I felt like it was going to kill me. We're at 50 new members, which is quite good. We'll likely see an uptick on Thursday, because people leave things until last minute. I'd likely have been there if I hadn't screwed up the live for my members; after a fight with my [husband] (significant other). I'd be happy to see 60 new members.

Now I'd like to put you into your presentation groups. This requires you to move around a bit.

:::tip PSA
If you weren't here this week, be sure to reach out with your group and share your top 3 business ideas.
:::

### Business Ideas

So, we have had around 10-15 mins to talk, some groups had some good conversations. Lets hear some of what you guys talked about.

:::info Some ideas from the class

- Nieche podcasts,
- Small jewlery.
- Rental company, renting out furnature to uni students.
- Stooping, when people leave stuff "free to take", then making it better, reselling.
- Costume Design for Irish Dance
- D&D hold sessions for new players to teach/run game.

### Brainstorming - Skills & Talents

So, why is it that you are dreading thinking about your skills and talents? Why does it feel like something hard to do? "Self reflecting. I don't like that". "Whenever you're good at something you'll find out that someone else is better and/or opening up to critisisms". So, take around 15 index cards and pass the stack along. So, everyone's got a pen with index cards.

We're doing this exercise because we are all more or less socialized to be a bit out of touch with what we're good at. It's because it's not modest to know what you're good at. "I" think it's dangerous to go through life without knowing what you're good at and it makes people unhappy. "I" also think that starting a business without understanding what you bring to it is courting disaster. We're fine with failure. BUT: I think you can get into trouble if you're good at something and you don't know it, or vise-versa. Self-reflective moments now and then. At your age it'll be changing all the time. Do it once a year or so just to check in.

The downside of not knowing what you're good at:

Previous to Western, tought at university in Baltimore. It was a snake pit, lots of competitiveness in meetings. People were assholes, others were powerhouses. From that experience I took on sounding authoritative. After I left that job, in small group situations people would think that I as in / on board / it was the best idea. It took a series of non-work situations to realize that sounding authoritative was good, especially in teaching although I needed to learn how to dial it back.

Series of prompts: Write one skill on each index card. Quantity over quality.

### Ask Yourself --

:::note
:::

#### Think about your life, not just your Western Life. Are there things you don't really do much anymore.

#### So, what was that like? how did it feel?

## The First assignment

Ok. So the first assignment is on OWL and will become available to you right at the end of class. Before I tell you what's in it, I'd like to make some things clear. Some of you had no idea what you signed up for when you joined. I'm asking you to do non-standard FIMS things. If I asked you to do experiments then gave you bad grades for it.

Grades are terrible. They make people super-risk-adverse. Risk-aversion and entropreneurship do not go well together. When I read the first part, is this person taking a risk? If so, encourage rather than punish.

I don't want these to be scary, adversive, or even very difficult.

The first assignment is a list of prompts that we used in class today, then the assignment asks you to re-visit your cards. Now that it's feeding you this question, continue writing these down for the next 24 hrs, then revisit the categorization question. In the next couple days, ask people you trust / know you well if they have anything to add. Then, there will be 3 options on how to write about what you've learned.

1. Did you learn something about yourself you weren't fully aware of
2. Patterns
3. If you find this adversive, think about why.

400-500 words **HARD LIMIT** about one of those questions.

You're going to turn-it-in via OWL. **\*\*It is due the day of class at 3pm.\*\***

You can write in the first person **please do**. There is not a particular format. Informal essay. Is it OK to use contractions? Yes. **No citations**.

### Assignment Instructions

1. Continue exploring and listing your skills and talents using the questions we discussed in class. And ask friends, family, and mentors what they think you're good at:

   - think about your whole life, not just your Western life (i.e. think about your pastâ€”skills you haven't used in a long time)

   - think about all areas of your life, not just "professional" skills

   - ask yourself: what's easy for me, even effortless? (We often don't consider things that are easy for us skills. They are.)

   - another version: what do you do when you feel stressed?

   - ask yourself: when do I feel most alive/happiest/strongest etc?

   - another version: what do you do when you feel stressed?

   - what compliments do you often brush off?

   - are there areas in which you have some skills and want to get better?

   - what skills have you been forced to develop?

   - what makes you a little odd?

   - are there skills that you have but wish you didn't have?

   - what topics can't you stop talking about?

   - what do you know a lot about just because you're intrinsically motivated to learn more?

When you're satisfied with your list, go on to step 2.

2. Now you'll experiment with identifying patterns and relating your skills to each other. You can use whatever categories make sense to you. You might consider categories like:

   - things I'm good at that I haven't done in a long time
   - things I'm good at that I love doing
   - things I'm good at that I don't love doing
   - skills I could get paid for
   - skills I want to get better at

3. Choose one of the following prompts and write a short, informal (but well-organized, well-edited, and well-proofread) essay.

   - Write a short, informal essay about what you've discovered about yourself by doing these exercises.
   - Write about the patterns you discovered after making your list.
   - If you found listing your skills difficult or unpleasant, write about why.

First we're going to talk about our small-business ideas, then I'm going to collect some prompts, talk about the first assignment and have our first presentation.

I just want to spend some time to talk about my launch which is happening now. There've been some moments where I felt like it was going to kill me. We're at 50 new members, which is quite good. We'll likely see an uptick on Thursday, because people leave things until last minute. I'd likely have been there if I hadn't screwed up the live for my members; after a fight with my [husband] (significant other). I'd be happy to see 60 new members.

Now I'd like to put you into your presentation groups. This requires you to move around a bit.

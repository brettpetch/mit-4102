What should you be focusing on? When I first founded Sheepspot, I thought that I&#x27;d be the first breed-specific yarn company. There is an enormous variety of the wool sheep can produce. Alot of the breeds that produce wool that I want to work with are endangered. In the main part of the wool industry, there are ideas of which sheep that should be raised. Then for those that want for meat, they want easy births, quick maturation, and none of the sheep I love most in the world fit that model. Commerical agriculturalists want things done a certain way. We see this in populations of all sorts of farm animals: we&#x27;re losing genetic diversity. These are things I learned as a spinner, not a knitter. Knitters don&#x27;t seem to know a whole lot about types of wool; it&#x27;s not something not a knitter would know.</p><p>What if I found local flocks in the area with unusual flocks, and pay farmers more than the collective would offer. I would then hand-dye / process it myself, get people involved in preserving breeds, giving more economic incentive for the farmer. Managing a flock for wool production requires extra labour. Economics don&#x27;t normally work out. It&#x27;s not worth it to them if they get $1/2 a lb. I was prepared to pay $5-8 per pound.</p><p>I was going to find flocks, buy their wool. Work with small spinning mills to process the yarn, then dye the resulting product, sell as a &quot;high end&quot; yarn. This lasted for a little while. So I started buying many pounds of wool at a time, 150-200lb at a time. Helped on sheering day, skirted properly (taking the poo out of them), bundling them in my car, then driving them to the mill. There aren&#x27;t that many mills in Canada, and faced the issue of how to get the wool into the US for processing. Once you hit buying wool, you run into issues with NAFTA. It&#x27;s much harder to move any fiber around because of NAFTA.</p><p>The next problem came at <strong>small mills</strong>. Any good small processing mill has a backlog of about a year. I could find the most lovely wool in the world, surmount the NAFTA problem, find a mill that was able to process the fiber in the way I wanted; then I&#x27;d wait for a year. I&#x27;m out the $$ but don&#x27;t have product for a year. I found that I didn&#x27;t enjoy the process of going to the farms and going through the fleeces. It was alot of travel and I had to go places, etc. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this. I did produce 4 batches of breed-specific yarns, some did better than others. I also discovered once I had yarn, I didn&#x27;t know that knitters want yarn, but they also want patterns. They want to buy yarn and have the sense they know what they want to do with it.</p><p>I know designers, but I was not interested in being in the pattern business. I said to myself &quot;those pesky knitters&quot;, found this irritating. I found this irritating to my customers, around 2015, we</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2015"></a>2015:<a class="hash-link" href="#2015" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>I was tired of knitters, I wanted to serve spinners. Most of my audience were spinners. I really loved dying unspun fiber. I have some for y&#x27;all to look at. My studio manager died it. I decided that I was going to phase out, decided that I wanted to spin fiber only. There are fewer spinners in the world than there are knitters. We&#x27;re the advanced form of &#x27;weird&#x27;, which is why I love them. I struggled for a bit, but I want to do some teaaching</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2017"></a>2017:<a class="hash-link" href="#2017" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>What if I opened up a studio? Then I can work out of my studio and also teach. Then I realized that I don&#x27;t love people in my &#x27;open&#x27; studio. It was like a party. I taught a bunch of classes, etc. but I didn&#x27;t like that, I hate parties.</p><p>In 2016, I created a subscription, and I also had a membership model which was made in 2019. With direct retail, you have no idea of revenue month-to-month.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="tldr"></a>TL;DR<a class="hash-link" href="#tldr" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The shifts from high-end yarn to fibre, then the shift to the recurring revenue business model.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="income"></a>Income<a class="hash-link" href="#income" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Income turns into revenue.</p><p>Let&#x27;s talk about how we make money. The &quot;current&quot;. I get a different breed every month, they get a session of my spinning the wool for them, etc. This is how I make money? $49/mo $499 for the year. It&#x27;s got some feature of an online course, then another part that&#x27;s a subscription of wool to your door. Then there&#x27;s the membership in terms of how to spin. We cover the facets of spinning, how to prepare fiber for spinning, 12 month membership, 1 month per part. Improve skills in a way that is not overwhelming. Online shopping: membership gets first dibs on the spins. Membership+Fiber is a way of boosing sales.</p><p>We also do in-person sales. There were pre-covid festivals called &quot;Fiber Festivals&quot;, wooly celebration. Started in 2015, then I stopped doing them from covid and as the membership/course grows, I&#x27;ll phase them out because they&#x27;re a huge hassle. We were talking about digging deep, listened to the customer. It was great to finding out about my ICA. Then there&#x27;s other teaching, in person, but not alot because I don&#x27;t like to travel. I also write for spinning magazines.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="cogs-cost-of-goods-sold"></a>COGS: Cost of Goods Sold<a class="hash-link" href="#cogs-cost-of-goods-sold" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>It&#x27;s way more expensive to offer course / sub. DHL prices, etc.</p><p>Membership + Fiber: $37, $399.</p><p>Since Renee pointed this out I did the course, wild haire, I had this idea, then thought I found a good idea of my COGS, I lost money last year doing it. There&#x27;s definately an upside for it though, because people loved it. I was able to develop more things for people who are already customers. I was able to pivot, but when I re-launched the course I needed to increase the price by $100. I hadn&#x27;t put my overhead into the price of it. I sold more when it was more expensive. When we talk about product development. When perceived value is higher, it&#x27;s more likely to have a sale. We&#x27;re in the middle of a launch right now, which will be further discussed when we get to product development.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="growth"></a>Growth<a class="hash-link" href="#growth" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Growth turns into customers.</p><p>How do I do something that is more scaleble? If you&#x27;re interested in doing coaching, you&#x27;ll likely start a 1:1, but if you can figure out how to do 1:many model, there&#x27;s a physical limitation in what can be produced. If you don&#x27;t want to have a built-in-ceiling, you have to have a different model.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="how-do-i-get-new-customers-how-do-i-convince-them-to-part-with-their-money"></a>How do I get new customers, how do I convince them to part with their money?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-do-i-get-new-customers-how-do-i-convince-them-to-part-with-their-money" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="podcasting"></a>Podcasting<a class="hash-link" href="#podcasting" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Podcasting, the point is to get better at spinning <em>right away</em>. Before that, I would edit the crap out of them, etc. Now I write out either a loose script or a couple talking points. But my B- is pretty good. The thing about a podcast is that you have no idea who is listening to you.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="lead-magnets"></a>Lead Magnets<a class="hash-link" href="#lead-magnets" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>I do alot of lead magnets from the podcast, which is an Amy Porterfield technique that leads people to provide an email address for a resource. I know who people are and I can nurture relationships.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="paid-advertising"></a>Paid Advertising<a class="hash-link" href="#paid-advertising" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>I also do paid advertising, Facebook, Instagram, Magazines. We can buy space in weekly newsletter. You write part of their newsletter for them, that goes out to their whole subscription base. When I was launching membership, I had 700 people signup for emails right away. Since then I had 500 people sign up. I had this through an email list from a big spinoff magazine, they&#x27;re both quarterly. Small buisnesses, I didn&#x27;t see a big response from the newsletter &#x27;i won&#x27;, then bring people from the newsletter to signing up for $mything at the moment.</p><h6><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h6 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="facebook-advertising"></a>Facebook Advertising<a class="hash-link" href="#facebook-advertising" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h6><p>As the largest platform of mankind, you can be super specific about who sees them. You can see 5 ads and look into who sees them, etc. I know that FB and Instagram are the main targets. I&#x27;ve seen what is possible with IG ads, I&#x27;ll delete my Facebook ad. Seeing as Facebook broke the world, I don&#x27;t want that to be the way people encounter me.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="social-media"></a>Social Media<a class="hash-link" href="#social-media" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>There have been times where social media just means instagram. Facebook has a <strong>pixel</strong> which is a little piece of code that allows me to compare ips. That code reports to FB that they&#x27;ve been on my website. I can generate an audience using the pixel, &#x27;lookalike audiences&#x27; to the audience that the pixel has generated.</p><h6><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h6 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="ravelry"></a>Ravelry<a class="hash-link" href="#ravelry" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h6><p>Ravelry is an entire social media site to knitters. It&#x27;s very inexpensive. I can advertise directly to the spinning groups, I don&#x27;t see alot of traffic from it so I don&#x27;t do it anymore. If you&#x27;re a knitter you can use ravalry. The point is to make me happy. I try to do things that make me happy.</p><h6><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h6 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="mighty-networks"></a>Mighty Networks<a class="hash-link" href="#mighty-networks" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h6><p>Mighty Networks is a platform that allows a company/entity to setup a &#x27;facebook-like&#x27; feed where you own all your content. It&#x27;s one of the few Silicon Valley with a woman CEO (I love that). My Mighty Networks Group is called &quot;The Flock&quot;, it&#x27;s free to join. Everything else, Podcast, Emails, everything points here &quot;my hub&quot;.

# The Ocean Cleanup

Boyan Slat, a diver, 18, loves being in the ocean. He got really bummed out about all of the plastic he was seeing in the ocean. He had an idea and did a ted talk on it.

## Ideas for your Business

So, come up with a list of 20 potential business ideas that are alignment with your interests or what skills and talent you might posses. These should be viable.

## The Ocean Cleanup (for realsies this time)

So the ocean cleanup is something that can be a good example of how everything works, their marketing really works for them.

Ok, so there's this huge problem, right? There's a simple solution. Boylan, 18 was able to raise $30 million in funding. They started to clean up the gyres. Ths is an 18 year old taking on a project of **this magnitude**, using various corporate and private gifts. Now he employs marine biologsts, etc. but is still facing one problem.

**the first iteration didn't work**, but instead of giving up, he iterated and went again. They've got a very interesting relationship with setbacks and failure.

So imagine this scenario, you had a big failure. Everything hit the fan. What is it that we're going to say to these investors and how do you save the project?

- Be honest
- Try to explain what happened
- Brainstorm about how to get to the next interation.

Some articles tried to discredit Boyan, but instead of feeding the press, he dug in and kept going. So, from this, he did system 001b. System 001b was a smaller scale version of system001, and they tested and learned a bunch. 6 weeks ago, they deployed the first parts of system002. In its testing, The Ocean Cleanup was able to pull out 8 tons of garbage. It's working. While it is still in testing, and they're only tackling one garbage patch, the data is being used to make **5 of them**.

So changing gears a bit, interceptor 004 was made to pull out of the rivers, where an impressive amount of plastics come from. The system emulates an artificial shoreline and then fills dumpsters. Operators take the dumpster, remove the materials, then put them back to be filled.

So, who are we talking to?

- Investors (show where money is going)
- Money
- Government officials (to apply public pressure)
- The Public (who are they?)
  - Locals/Tourists (alot of the costs are related to dollars lost if the environment wasn't pristine)
  - Students (someone that is environmentally aware/interested)
  - Activists (inspiration)
  - Future volunteers.
  - Talking to their critics, the amount of flack they got from the garbage patches, they're addressing rivers showing that they can scale up

### Ocean Cleanup Sunglasses

So, here we see how to make The Ocean Cleanup sustainable. This is in two parts, ecologically, and raising money to sustain the cleanup. So in making it financially sustainable, the team made sunglasses from the garbage patch in the gyres. They did a huge launch, doing unboxing videos. Before watching these videos, think about

- How are they made?
- How are they giving it value?
- How would it be a good idea to buy one?
- A new way to clean the oceans?

So, let's answer those questions

- unboxing
- clear through accents in the video that it's a global project
- you're meeting the team behind them
- Commitment
- Memory
- uniqueness
- Bringing it back to the origin story
- Most sunglasses don't have a QR code.
  - when you go to it, they're turning you into an ambassador, somewhat viral.
- Carrying around the bags, they're made from garbage (and are the same ones they use in the video)
- Turning literal garbage into very specific garbage (specificity)
  - Ensured (chain of custody) that only their garbage was used.
    - Authentication!, makes more valuable.
    - It's like a coffee in the way the plastics were selected, it's from this place, using this kind of dirt, etc.
    - Showing process, we see the plastic
    - Requires expertise, sorted by hand. Alot of work, both physically, intellectually, showing the process works!
    - Box is SEALED.

All of "this" is being done with words and images, it's not the object.

Now try [going to their website](https://products.theoceancleanup.com/), is there anything you notice there?

- The way they're visualizing it, 24 football fields
- Donation to the cause to receive product.
- Value pricing
  - They're $200 USD. Get away with it because they have done the work of setting expectations.
- Call to action (asks you to do something)
  - Very specific. It says "contribute"
  - Trying to produce engagement using football fields, 64% of goal.
- Price
  - It's a high qulity materials
  - Not actually worth $200 USD
  - Signed to contributor, value.
    - Psycologically
    - Pricing is part of the marketing / creating value

So what is their strategy?

Strategy = plan, Tactics = action items

- Purchasing == Fundraising.
- demonstrates the full circuit process of turning trash into treasure.
- Word of mouth -> AUTHENTIC.
- Personal engagement.
- Giving the company a face. For their promo strategy, they have a FACE.
- [The Sales Page](https://products.theoceancleanup.com/)
  - Tactics
    - Counter
    - Testemonials (are social proof)
    - Scrolls with infographics
    - A LOT OF INFO
    - 1 Product, 1 choice
    - Persistent button
    - QR code
    - Antoher thing -> more info
      - you see one thing, then you see another thing about it, then another thing, then anotherthing...

So for [SheepSpot](https://www.sheepspot.com/), ask yourself...

- Skills/Talents
- Value / Mission
- Ideal Customer Avatar

Why do they light up?

- Helping others, spinning, customer nurture.
- Doing the hard work for you
  - How animals were treated
  - Where the wool is coming from
  - Providing visually.
  - Different farms
- (one of the pages is not open to customers yet)
  - Exclusivity

ICA

- Stressed spinners
- Organize
- niche, community
- Loyal

Values

- Has a day job
  - Letting customers know they're dealing with constraints.
  - Community -> standing up for social causes. Thoughts on gender violence.
    - If people don't feel the same way, unfollow.
    - One of the things is that, as a bi-racial female, it's easer to repel people by doing a "we're not for you".
    - That was a way to strengthen the community.
      - One of the ways to surround yourself with like-minded people
    - It's inquisitive. People that want to **get better**

So, for next week: what are you good at? we're going to start it in class, then write it up for next week. Due oct. 6th.
